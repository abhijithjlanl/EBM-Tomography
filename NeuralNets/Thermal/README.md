## Neural net representation for thermal states

The code here is similar to the ground state example.
The samples from thermal states are generated using the C++ version of ITensor
After installing ITensor with HDF5 support, run `make` in this folder to recomplie the `thermal.o`  executable. 

Note: It is seen that HDF5 1.12 breaks ITensor. This code was tested with version 1.10
